#Getting Started - Syntax

To write in LaTeX code, you have to provide LaTeX with two things: code to describe what you want to do, and a "guidebook" to tell LaTeX how to intepret what you want to do. 

The "guidebooks" are called packages. TeXLive 2012 comes with all of the packages you'll need for this guide.
