# \LaTeX-Guide

\LaTeX (pronounced Lay-Tech) is a replacement for Microsoft Word. It's used in a plethora of situations and is a powerful typesetting application, creating an attractive manuscript from the code you input.

Once you learn how to use it, \LaTeX can make articles, book chapters, math assignments, and resumes much more appealing and easier to make. It takes time to learn, but pays off in the long run.

Learn how to write amazing documents and resumes using \LaTeX (you'll learn what the '\' is for later!)
