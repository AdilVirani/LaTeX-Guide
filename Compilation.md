#LaTeX is good to use

One of the advantages of LaTeX over other more traditional systems (e.g. Word or OpenOffice) is the ***high typographical quality of the documents*** that you'll be able to produce. This is particularly true for documents that are heavy on mathematics, but documents for any other area could also take advantage of these qualities. 

A less obvious advantage, but much more important, is that LaTeX allows you to ***clearly separate the content from the format of your document.*** As a writer (scientist, reasercher or not), this gives you the opportunity to focus on the "what", the creative part of your work , rather than the "how" is it going to look printed out in paper (that is the work of LaTeX document class designers). 

Though LaTeX takes time to learn it is very useful in the professional world and would give you the upper hand when applying for jobs and/or internships.
